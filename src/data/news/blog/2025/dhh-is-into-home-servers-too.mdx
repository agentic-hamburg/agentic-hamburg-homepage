**Draft placeholder ahead:** this is intentionally short, silly text so editors
can see layout, spacing, and voice before a real article replaces it. Please do
not treat any sentence below as factual reporting.

## Why this makes no sense

Blip-blop flux capacitors hum quietly in a Hamburg basement while someone
mumbles "agentic spaghetti" into a microphone. That's the entire thesis of this
draft: it's absurd on purpose so reviewers immediately mark it as example copy.

## How to read this thing

- **Pretend runbooks** – Step one: find a waffle iron, step two: declare it a
  cluster. That's it; the tooling is pure make-believe.
- **Edge-of-reality stacks** – Every service runs on vibes and a mislabeled USB
  stick. Deployment instructions consist of shrug emojis.
- **Shared absurdity** – Editors paste random lorem ipsum into the observability
  dashboards so nobody forgets this is a draft.

Still curious? Watch [DHH's full talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcwzWzC7gUA_)
and then write something real. Until then this stub just proves the markdown
layout, image, and quote render as expected.
