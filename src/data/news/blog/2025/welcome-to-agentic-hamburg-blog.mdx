Welcome to the Agentic Hamburg newsroom! This post is kept at the top of the
feed so newcomers immediately understand what we publish and how to plug into
the community.

## Why this space exists

Agentic coding means building software side-by-side with AI copilots and
autonomous helpers. Hamburg has plenty of people experimenting with those
workflows, so we created a collective place to document wins, missteps, and
in-progress tooling.

## What you can expect

- **Dispatches from the build nights** – short play-by-plays of how we combined
  humans + models to ship automations, and what broke along the way.
- **Deep dives on practices** – guides on eval harnesses, tool catalogs, and
  collaboration rituals that make agentic teams trustworthy.
- **Community spotlights** – conversations with the people running labs,
  companies, and civic projects across Hamburg.

## How to get involved

1. Subscribe to the newsletter on the home page to receive new posts and event
   invites.
2. Submit a draft or field note during our open newsroom hours; we love pairing
   on edits.
3. Visit the about page to meet the founders (Stefan + two Sebastians) and pick
   the right person to contact.
