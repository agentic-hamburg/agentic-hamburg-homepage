Welcome to the Agentic Hamburg Homepage! We're a community of builders, that's fascinated by the new world of agentic assistants. that 
want to learn from each other and share what we learned. Most of us come from a background of software development, but we're open for everybody curious.

## Why this space exists

Agentic coding means building software side-by-side with AI copilots and
autonomous helpers. Hamburg has plenty of people experimenting with those
workflows, so we created a collective place to document wins, missteps, and
in-progress tooling.

## What you can expect

- **Dispatches from the build nights** – short play-by-plays of how we combined
  humans + models to ship automations, and what broke along the way.
- **Deep dives on practices** – guides on eval harnesses, tool catalogs, and
  collaboration rituals that make agentic teams trustworthy.
- **Community spotlights** – conversations with the people running labs,
  companies, and civic projects across Hamburg.

## Our Mission

We bring together researchers, developers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts who are interested in the development and application of autonomous AI agents. Our goal is to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and drive innovation in this rapidly evolving field. 

## What We Do

Agentic Hamburg organizes meetups, workshops, and discussions around topics such as:

    Autonomous AI agent architectures and frameworks
    Multi-agent systems and coordination
    AI agent safety and alignment
    Practical applications in business and research
    Emerging tools and technologies in the agentic AI space
