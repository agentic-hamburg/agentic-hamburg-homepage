I love how new terms are being coined at the moment. Simon Willison's post about getting [from Vibe coding to Vibe engineering](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) is a perfect example. Unfortunately, it's missing one key property of codebases: The differing viscosities of your files and often lines.

The blog post is a superb summary of things to look out for efficiently coding with agents. I found myself nodding at every bullet point. As an engineering leader who pitched a lot of these for implementation, it often feels like we can ultimately prove now that good software engineering practices have a business impact, instead of being misunderstood as a goodie for the engineers...

One aspect was lacking, and in the spirit of coining terms, I'd like to name it viscosity of software. Every codebase has fast, easy-to-change parts and almost impossible-to-change parts. If you draft to change them, you'll spend the whole week convincing other engineers. These crucial files or lines have many implications to the whole project. It's often unclear which lines are written in stone and which are written in sand.

Another way to frame this is tribal knowledge: Engineers accustomed to this codebase know these corners from their own experience or because of the stories around it. So far, I didn't find a way to onboard my agents with this knowledge. Every agent comes in like a new developer, not knowing anything about the code. It's amazing how fast they navigate the codebase. The AGENTS.md and code comments help a bit, but it's a main frustration point when relying more on agents. They're unaware of this tribal knowledge and I don't know how to teach them.

How do we teach a machine to be afraid of the right lines of code? I'd love to hear your thoughts.
